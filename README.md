Formulas:

1. Mean: The arithmetic average of a set of values.
   Formula: \(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i}{n}\)

2. Median: The middle value of a dataset when arranged in ascending or descending order.
   - For an odd number of values: Middle number
   - For an even number of values: Average of the two middle numbers

3. Mode: The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.

4. Variance: The average of the squared differences from the mean.
   Formula: \(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})^2}{n}\)

5. Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance. It measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a dataset.
   Formula: \(\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \bar{X})^2}{n}}\)

6. Correlation: Measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.
   Formula: \(r = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}\)

7. Regression: Predicts the value of one variable based on another. A linear regression equation has the form \(y = mx + c\).

8. T-Test: Determines if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.
   Formula: \(t = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{n_1} + \frac{s^2}{n_2}}}\)

9. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Assesses whether there are statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups.
   Formula: \(F = \frac{\text{Between Group Variability}}{\text{Within Group Variability}}\)

10. Chi-Square Test: Determines whether there is a significant association between categorical variables.
    Formula: \(\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}\)

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis involves applying statistical methods to collect, organize, analyse, interpret, and present data. It helps in extracting meaningful insights, identifying trends, making predictions, and drawing conclusions from data. 

1. Descriptive Statistics:
    Project: Analysing census data to understand population demographics, using measures like mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.

2. Inferential Statistics:
    Project: Conducting hypothesis tests to determine student's test cases.

3. Regression Analysis:
    Project: Predicting housing prices based on variables like location, size, and amenities using linear regression models.

4. Time Series Analysis:
    Project: Analysing stock market trends over time to forecast market analysis.

5. Survival Analysis:
    Project: Estimating the survival rate of patients after a specific treatment in medical research.

6. Factor Analysis:
    Project: Reducing dimensions in marketing data to identify underlying factors influencing consumer behaviour.

7. Cluster Analysis:
    Project: Grouping customers based on their purchasing behaviours for targeted marketing strategies in retail.

8. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):
    Project: Comparing the effectiveness of different teaching methods in improving students' test scores.

9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
    Project: Reducing the dimensionality of data in genetics research to identify principal genetic components.

10. Multivariate Analysis:
    Project: Analysing simultaneous relationships between multiple variables, education.
